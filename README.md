## About the Game

Food Wars is a gameshow-oriented game created to help primary school children have fun while playing games!  
The game will have differing levels of difficulty for children from different primary levels and within each primary level, there would be different restaurants to conquer!      That's right! Our game is set is a restaurant scene where players would compete to get ingredients and complete their dishes!  

## Setting up the backend[^1].

1. Copy the file titled "serviceAccountKey.json" (sent to you separately via SVN) into your "Nodejs_Server\configs\" directory

2. Change directory to  "\Nodejs_Server\" and run the command:

```bash
npm install
```

3. run the command (without quotation marks) 

```bash
npm start
# You should see the next line: 
# Server is running on port 3000.

```
